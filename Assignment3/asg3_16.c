/*
16. Write a program to develop a very simple version of the ''guess the magic number" game. The
	program generates a random magic number between 1 and 1000. Ask user to guess the
	number. If guess is correct then print message “congrats! You won.” if the guess is less than
	magic number print the message ** left ** otherwise print the message ** right **. Repeat the
	procedure till player give accurate guess. Give maximum 10 chances to user.
	
	Note: generates the magic number using the standard random number generator rand( ), which
	returns an arbitrary number between 0 and RAND_MAX (which defines an integer value that
	is 32,767 or larger). The rand( ) function requires the header <stdlib.h>.
